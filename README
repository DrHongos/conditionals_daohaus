// changes to consider
// contract
    make indexSet.length publicly fetchable
    // or maybe return all positionsSum in a vector? like currentDistribution() public view returns (uint[] memory) {}

// frontend
    fetch number of outcomes from the contract (maybe in the same call of global values)

// subgraph
    setProbabilityDistribution event >  user's first opinion about it    
need to get list of positions timestamped:         
    new user attributo (to get a lineal plot) number of users vs time
    total sum of each outcome (to get a stacked area graph) probability (normalized) vs time
    PROBLEM: a user change of opinion has no link with previous values, how can i substract those values from positionsSum?
